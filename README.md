My name is Lucia Rodriguez, an telecommunication engineer form

Telecommunications engineer from the University of Seville. 
My specialty in the degree was image and sound. I hope I can continue training in this and many more concepts related to engineering.

I am currently working on a project where it integrates
- Unity 3D
- C #
- Python
- Message passing with MQTT

I have little work experience, but I consider myself to be a person who quickly learns the concepts that are presented to me.
