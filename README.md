I am a Telecommunications Engineer with a specialization in Sound and Image.
My expertise lies in scripting with Python, leveraging libraries like Pandas and processing XML and JSON data.

I have a strong command of web development technologies, including Django, React, and JavaScript/TypeScript. 
I have also worked with tools such as Google Apps Script, VBA, VB.NET, C#, and Unity 3D.

While my primary passion revolves around desktop applications, I am currently focused on web development, continuously expanding my knowledge and skill set to deliver high-quality solutions.
